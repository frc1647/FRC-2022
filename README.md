# Team 1647's Rapid React robot code
This is our code for our 2022 robot! It features code for a fully operational swerve drivetrain (no super-niche features though), multiple autonomus sequences, and much more!

*Introduction*

This readme, and this entire codebase, contains a lot of information about how things work and what things do (at least it should). This includes general explanations of how the wpilib framework (TimedRobot in this case) works and interacts with the written code. This is intended to make the code easier to grasp for less experienced/knowledgeable students, and as intuitive as possible.

*In the beginning, there was Main.java*

As you may expect, the code begins at the Main file. It immediately sends us to to the initialization sequence in the Robot file...
